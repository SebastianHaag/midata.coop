               MIDATA is a member-owned Swiss cooperative that provides individuals with secure personal data accounts to collect, store, manage, analyze and - if they choose to - share their personal health data.

               We believe that giving the individual citizen full control over his or her health data is the most just and efficient way to unlock the power of these data for the individual's personal health and for society at large.

            <h3>The big idea</h3>
            <p>
               MIDATA's vision is to return control over personal data back to the individuals who generate them. every individual should be able to collect data from diverse sources in a secured platform where they can manage and analyze these data. Individuals should control who gets access to which data, for how long and for what purpose.

         <div class="small-12 medium-6 large-4 columns hbloc">
            <h3>The platform</h3>
            <p>
               MIDATA platform is designed by tech informatics department of the ETH Zürich and is being implemented by the department of medical informatics of the Technical University of the canton Bern (Berner Fachhochschule).  It is currently in development and accordancing to MIDATA's principle of transparency, the code will be open source.

            <h3>Using your personal data</h3>
            <p>
               In the MIDATA view, control over ones personal data is not a goal in itself. Instead we believe that control over ones data only becomes meaningful when the individuals use these data to answer concrete questions and to solve concrete problems. This is why the start-up phase of MIDATA will focus on projects, in which groups of individuals will use the MIDATA platform to collect, administer and pool their personal data to achieve a clearly defined common goal. A list of projects that are currently under way or in planning can be found here.

            <h3>The cooperative</h3>
            <p>
               MIDATA was founded on Feb. 4th. 2015 as a Swiss cooperative (Genossenschaft) with its seat in the town of Schlieren (canton Zürich).  A list of  the founding members can be found here.

            <h3>Security</h3>
            <p>
               Data security is of the utmost importance. The data in the personal MIDATA data accounts are encrypted in such a way that only the account owner him- or herself can read them. Not even the MIDATA system administrator can read the data in the accounts! The data are stored on Swiss servers of a Swiss Internet provider and therefore fall under the full protection of the very stringent Swiss data protection laws. MIDATAs organization as a Swiss cooperative (Genossenschaft) affords the account holders ownership not only of the data in their account but also of the MIDATA platform on which these data are stored. In addition, Swiss cooperatives cannot be sold, a takeover of the data platform by a third party is therefore not possible.

            <h3>Personal Data</h3>
            <p>
               Regardless of whether we visit a doctor, surf the Internet, use an app on our smartphone, take a course at the university or go shopping in the supermarket- data about us is collected, analyzed and stored long-term. Even though we are the source of all these data we rarely know exactly what data is collected or how it is used. Nor can we access this data for our own use.
